# Rick Cogley Central

Hi, this is the repository for my "[Rick Cogley Central](http://rick.cogley.info)" site, which is built on the blazing fast static site generator called "[Hugo](http://gohugo.io)". Hugo's compiled, so once you have the binary in your system path, you can use it to generate your site in seconds, viewing a local copy in real time. You create content in markdown using toml or yaml frontmatter, templates in html using some codes which Hugo will substitute when building, and static assets like css, javascript or images. The project provides compiled binaries, and if you're on a Mac, it's easy to install via homebrew, as `brew install hugo` for the stable, or `brew install hugo --HEAD` for the dev version.

## Acknowledgements

* Big thanks to [Steve Francia](http://spf13.com) (@spf13) and [contributors](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/graphs/contributors) for the giant amount of work in creating Hugo, and to the Go language [team](http://golang.org/CONTRIBUTORS) itself. 

* The look of the site is based on [Tom Maiaroto's](http://shift8creative.com) (@tmaiaroto) "[RedLounge](https://github.com/tmaiaroto/hugo-redlounge)" theme for Hugo, which is itself based on [a demo](http://purecss.io/layouts/blog) from Yahoo's excellent, responsive css modules set called "[PureCSS](http://purecss.io)". PureCSS lets you easily set up responsive grids, that resize when you resize the browser or view on a mobile device like an iPad or iPhone. 

* I'm using the "Alegreya" type faces by [Juan Pablo del Peral](http://www.huertatipografica.com/about), served up by Google Web Fonts. You can view and purchase the sans serif [Alegreya Sans HT](http://www.huertatipografica.com/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht) and serif [Alegreya HT Pro](http://www.huertatipografica.com/fonts/alegreya-ht-pro) versions at his site. 

* The "carbon fiber" sidebar background is pure css, and was written by [Atle Mo and Sebastien Grosjean](http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/#carbon). If it does not work, upgrade your browser. If it does work, upgrade anyway. 

* My photos are being displayed by the slick javascript [nanoGALLERY](http://nanogallery.brisbois.fr), and thanks to [Bjørn Erik Pedersen](http://bep.is) (@bep) for the guidance on how to integrate it with Hugo (and for your many kindnesses to this newbie on the Hugo [discussion forums](http://discuss.hugo.io)). 

* Comments are probably going to be handled in Discourse. Not sure as of 1 May 2015.
