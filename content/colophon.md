      <!--Body content-->
      <p>As they say, we "<em>stand on the shoulders of giants</em>", and this site is certainly no exception. After a while watching my <a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rickcogley/8423163176/in/photostream" title="Link to image of breaking website, previous version." target="_blank">previous site</a> deteriorate, I decided to employ a "baked" style of website, which involves generating locally, and copying static HTML, CSS and Javascript files up to the server. There are too many <a rel="bookmark" href="https://pinboard.in/u:rickcogley/bundle:JRC_Static_Site_Generators/" title="Link to Rick's Pinboard.in list of Static Site Generators" target="_blank">static site generators</a> these days, but due to the popularity of <a rel="bookmark" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-github-alt"></i>Github</a>, <a rel="bookmark" href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> is a well-supported one, written in the popular <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" rel="bookmark" title="Ruby Language" target="_blank">Ruby</a> language. After a lot of waffling, I decided on a wrapper around Jekyll called <a rel="bookmark" href="http://octopress.org/" target="_blank">Octopress</a>.</p>
<p>You really need to be a bit of a hacker, to use a static site generator. Octopress was complete and polished enough that I could learn the related technologies at my own pace. An ulterior motive was that I wanted to learn how to use git, as all the cool kids are using it. The workflow of writing a post or page in markdown, adding it to my local git repository, committing it, pushing it, and deploying it to the site, has now become second nature. I am using Atech Media's <a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.codebasehq.com/" title="Atech Media CodebaseHQ git and subversion hosting." target="_blank">CodebaseHQ</a> and <a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.deployhq.com/" title="Atech Media DeployHQ to auto-copy a git repo to a server." target="_blank">DeployHQ</a> to host my repo and deploy its files to my site folder, over at the rock-solid <a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.webfaction.com?affiliate=rcogley" title="Webfaction hosting link." target="_blank">Webfaction</a>.</p>
<p>I hired <span id="itemscope" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><span itemprop="name"><em>Paul Serous</em></span>, <span itemprop="jobTitle">Web Developer</span>, (<a itemprop="url" href="http://about.me/paul_ser" title="Paul Ser profile page" target="_blank">Profile</a>)</span></span> who is based in the Ukraine, to coach me in learning git and the other technologies I need to know, and, to do the heavy ruby programming that I have no time or need to learn. He did an exemplary job not only on those things, but going the extra mile to adapt a responsive HTML5 and CSS3 <a rel="bookmark" href="http://themeforest.net/item/justi-responsive-html5css3-template/2733629" title="Justi HTML5 and CSS3 theme based on Twitter Bootstrap" target="_blank">theme</a> based on the famous and somewhat ubiquitous <a rel="bookmark" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" title="Twitter Bootstrap - responsive HTML5 and CSS3 framework." target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, up and running on this site. I really appreciate his quality work, help and patience.</p>
<p>A lot goes into the cosmetic look of a site, namely with <a rel="bookmark" title="Permanent bookmark for Cascading Style Sheets" href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a> for visual styling, and javascript such as <a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="bookmark" title="JQuery site." target="_blank">JQuery</a> or what Twitter has written into Bootstrap for effects. We started with a basic theme, but there are a lot of actors playing on the stage you see now. I'm using Adobe TypeKit <a href="https://typekit.com/colophons/opc8mtb" rel="bookmark" title="Webfonts from Adobe used in this site." target="_blank">webfonts</a>, namely <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-text-pro" rel="bookmark" title="Freight Text Pro web font details page." target="_blank">Freight Text Pro</a> for the body text, <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/adelle-web" rel="bookmark" title="Adelle web font details page." target="_blank">Adelle</a> for the headings, and <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/source-code-pro" rel="bookmark" title="Source Code Pro web font details page." target="_blank">Source Code Pro</a> for monospace code blocks, primarily because they look good, and it means a consistent look to the site for most viewers with modern browsers. Also, because <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/" rel="bookmark" title="Font Awesome icon fonts" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> icon fonts and <a href="http://glyphicons.com/" rel="bookmark" title="Glyphicon icons" target="_blank">Glyphicons</a> are included with Twitter Bootstrap, those too are taken advantage of in the design.</p>
<p>As you browse around, you may see that <a rel="bookmark" title="Semantic H.T.M.L. Wikipedia article link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">Semantic HTML</a> is the base, while I'm using some now-well-accepted <a href="http://schema.org/" rel="bookmark" title="Canonical site for Microdata, Schema.org." target="_blank">Microdata</a> such as the <a href="http://schema.org/Person" rel="bookmark" title="Microdata Person schema." target="_blank">Person</a> schema, and <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a> such as <a href="http://www.microformats.org/wiki/hcard" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent bookmark for hcard Microformat">hCard</a>, with <a href="http://www.microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag" rel="bookmark" title="Rel-tag Microformat">rel-tag</a> sprinkled in around the site.</p>
