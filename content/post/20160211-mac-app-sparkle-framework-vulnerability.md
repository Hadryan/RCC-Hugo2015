Many Mac app developers use the Sparkle framework for updating their apps, but a recent security vulnerability discovery puts your Mac at risk.

## Apps using older Sparkle over http are vulnerable

Ars Technica posted a troubling  [article](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/02/huge-number-of-mac-apps-vulnerable-to-hijacking-and-a-fix-is-elusive/) about the http man-in-the-middle security vulnerability that was discovered in the well-used Sparkle Framework. Here's the [original article](https://vulnsec.com/2016/osx-apps-vulnerabilities/) with lots of technical detail.

Sparkle updated their code immediately to patch, in [release 1.13.1](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases/tag/1.13.1), but developers using the framework have to do the work to update to ``1.13.1``, and make sure all connections are done over https.

### Which of my apps use which version of Sparkle?

There's a [big list](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/issues/717) of apps that use Sparkle, but rest assured, if you're a Mac user, your apps are likely using it.

Ars technica user "ryanr" shows a Terminal command that can be used to list up what apps on your system are using Sparkle, and what version.

{{< prism bash command-line >}}find /Applications -path '*Autoupdate.app/Contents/Info.plist' -exec echo {} \; -exec grep -A1 CFBundleShortVersionString '{}' \; | grep -v CFBundleShortVersionString
{{< /prism >}}

However, if you use ``brew cask`` to install like I do, your apps are located in a different folder. To get _their_ information, just change the path to ``/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom`` like so:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}find /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom -path '*Autoupdate.app/Contents/Info.plist' -exec echo {} \; -exec grep -A1 CFBundleShortVersionString '{}' \; | grep -v CFBundleShortVersionString
{{< /prism >}}

... and so on, if you use different locations from the standard ``/Applications``.

### What you can do

Ars offers this advice:

> People who aren't sure if an app on their Mac is safe should consider avoiding unsecured Wi-Fi networks or using a virtual private network when doing so.

In the end, what you can do is keep after the developers of the apps you use, and keep your apps updated. Ping the developers on Twitter or via email.

Thinking about this incident, it really shows you how important good encryption is, and why it should be a standard. Generally speaking, boo to the US legislators pining to remove encryption.

## Updates

* **11 Feb 2016** - Codekit, Noun Project and AirParrot responded that their apps are not vulnerable. Peter Borg responded that Lingon is patched.
