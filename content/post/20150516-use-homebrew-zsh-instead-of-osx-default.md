The [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) shell that Apple provides in OS Yosemite is out of date, as of the time of this article in May 2015. It's trivial to install the latest version, available on ``homebrew``, and here's a couple of steps you need to do to make that your default. Read on for how to do it.

## Initial Confirmations

Confirm the current zsh version:

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % zsh --version
zsh 5.0.5 (x86_64-apple-darwin14.0)
~~~

Confirm the location of zsh:

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % which zsh
/bin/zsh
~~~

Confirm the shells OS X knows about:

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % cat /etc/shells
# List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).
# Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using
# one of these shells.

/bin/bash
/bin/csh
/bin/ksh
/bin/sh
/bin/tcsh
/bin/zsh
~~~

## Upgrade zsh with brew

Use `brew install zsh` to install.

~~~bash
rcogley@RickMBP ~ % brew install zsh
==> Installing zsh dependency: gdbm
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/gdbm-1.11.yosemite.bottle.2.tar.gz

### Confirm brew's zsh location

Apple provides `/usr/local` for OS X users to install packages to and it's already in your system path, so that's where `brew` installs. Confirm:

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % ls -la /usr/local/bin/zs*
lrwxr-xr-x  1 rcogley  wheel  27 May 16 10:54 /usr/local/bin/zsh@ -> ../Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh
lrwxr-xr-x  1 rcogley  wheel  33 May 16 10:54 /usr/local/bin/zsh-5.0.7@ -> ../Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh-5.0.7
~~~

But you can also use `brew` commands to confirm the details about the package:

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % brew list
aspell		automake	enscript	gettext		gsl114		libgpg-error	mtr		rsync
autoconf	bazaar		gdbm		go		jenv		libksba		pcre		zsh
me@mysys ~ % brew list zsh
/usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh
/usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh-5.0.7
/usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/lib/zsh/ (35 files)
/usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/share/info/ (7 files)
/usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/share/man/ (17 files)
/usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/share/zsh/ (1036 files)
~~~

And...

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % brew info zsh
zsh: stable 5.0.7 (bottled)
http://www.zsh.org/
/usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7 (1084 files, 11M) *
  Poured from bottle
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/zsh.rb
==> Dependencies
Required: gdbm ‚úî, pcre ‚úî
==> Options
--disable-etcdir
	Disable the reading of Zsh rc files in /etc
==> Caveats
Add the following to your zshrc to access the online help:
  unalias run-help
  autoload run-help
  HELPDIR=/usr/local/share/zsh/help
~~~

## Use the brew zsh

To use the zsh brew installed, you need to edit `/etc/shells`. It's owned by root, so use sudo to edit it. Here's one way:

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % sudo nano /etc/shells
Password:
~~~

Add the path to the `brew` zsh at the end, save (ctrl-o, ctrl-x), then confirm:

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % cat /etc/shells
# List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).
# Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using
# one of these shells.

/bin/bash
/bin/csh
/bin/ksh
/bin/sh
/bin/tcsh
/bin/zsh
/usr/local/bin/zsh
~~~

Now use `chsh` (change shell) to change to the `brew` zsh:

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
Changing shell for rcogley.
Password for rcogley:
~~~

If you run `which` again, you'll see the system is recognizing the one you installed:

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % which zsh
/usr/local/bin/zsh
~~~

And confirming the version shows:

~~~bash
me@mysys ~ % zsh --version
zsh 5.0.7 (x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0)
~~~

Et voil√†!
