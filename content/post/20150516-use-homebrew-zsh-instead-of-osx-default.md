The [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) shell that Apple provides in Mac OS X Yosemite is out of date, as of the time of this article in May 2015. It's trivial to install the latest version, available on ``homebrew``, and here's a couple of steps you need to do to make that your default. Read on for how to do it.

## Initial Confirmations

Confirm the current zsh version:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}zsh --version
zsh 5.0.5 (x86_64-apple-darwin14.0)
{{< /prism >}}

Confirm the location of zsh:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}which zsh
/bin/zsh
{{< /prism >}}

Confirm the shells OS X knows about:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}cat /etc/shells
  # List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).
  # Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using
  # one of these shells.
   /bin/bash
   /bin/csh
   /bin/ksh
   /bin/sh
   /bin/tcsh
   /bin/zsh
{{< /prism >}}

## Upgrade zsh with brew

{{< figure1 link="/img/homebrew.png" src="/img/homebrew.png" type="Logo" title="Homebrew" class="" >}}

Assuming you have ``brew`` installed, use `brew install zsh` to install.

{{< prism bash command-line >}}brew install zsh

{{< /prism >}}

### Confirm brew's zsh location

Apple provides `/usr/local` for OS X users to install packages to and it's already in your system path, so that's where `brew` installs. Confirm it:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}ls -la /usr/local/bin/zs*
  lrwxr-xr-x  1 rcogley  wheel  27 May 16 10:54 /usr/local/bin/zsh@ -> ../Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh
  lrwxr-xr-x  1 rcogley  wheel  33 May 16 10:54 /usr/local/bin/zsh-5.0.7@ -> ../Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh-5.0.7
{{< /prism >}}

But you can also use `brew` commands to confirm the details about the package:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}brew list
  aspell		automake	enscript	gettext		gsl114		libgpg-error	mtr		rsync
  autoconf	bazaar		gdbm		go		jenv		libksba		pcre		zsh
brew list zsh
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh-5.0.7
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/lib/zsh/ (35 files)
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/share/info/ (7 files)
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/share/man/ (17 files)
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/share/zsh/ (1036 files)
{{< /prism >}}

And...

{{< prism bash command-line >}}brew info zsh
  zsh: stable 5.0.7 (bottled)
  http://www.zsh.org/
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7 (1084 files, 11M) *

    autoload run-help

{{< /prism >}}

## Use the brew zsh

To use the ``zsh`` that brew installed, you need to edit `/etc/shells`. It's owned by root, so use sudo to edit it. Here's one way:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}sudo nano /etc/shells
Password: *********
{{< /prism >}}

Add the path to the `brew` zsh at the end, save (ctrl-o, ctrl-x if via nano), then confirm:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}cat /etc/shells
  # List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).
  # Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using
  # one of these shells.
   /bin/bash
   /bin/csh
   /bin/ksh
   /bin/sh
   /bin/tcsh
   /bin/zsh
   /usr/local/bin/zsh
{{< /prism >}}

Now use `chsh` (change shell) to change to the `brew` zsh:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
  Changing shell for rcogley.
  Password for rcogley: *********
{{< /prism >}}

After that, restart your Terminal to have it take effect.

Now if you run `which` again, you'll see the system is recognizing the one you installed:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}which zsh
  /usr/local/bin/zsh
{{< /prism >}}

And confirming the version again shows:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}zsh --version
  zsh 5.0.7 (x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0)
{{< /prism >}}

Et voil√†!

## Using Zsh

It's a matter for another post, but if you like zsh and want some cool tools for it, check out [Oh My Zsh!](http://ohmyz.sh/), an open source framework for managing Zsh config.

## Updates

* **24 Mar 2016** - cleaned up the post a bit. Added restarting Terminal, per comments (thanks!). Added ack section. Added link to [Oh My Zsh!](http://ohmyz.sh/).

The banner photo has nothing to do with zsh. It's a photo I took of hula dancers at Shonan Mall near Fujisawa, a number of years ago. See the original [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rickcogley/3580716109).

Thanks to Kirk Beard and Adam in the comments, regarding restarting Terminal to have the ``chsh`` take effect.
