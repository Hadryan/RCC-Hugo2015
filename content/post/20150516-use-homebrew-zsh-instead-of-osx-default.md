If the [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) shell that Apple provides in Mac OS X is out of date, as it has been in Yosemite and El Capitan, it's trivial to install the latest version, available on ``homebrew``. Here's a couple of steps you need to do to make that your default. Read on, for how to do it.

## Initial Confirmations

Confirm the current active ``zsh`` version:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}zsh --version
zsh 5.0.5 (x86_64-apple-darwin14.0)
{{< /prism >}}

Confirm the location of ``zsh``:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}which zsh
/bin/zsh
{{< /prism >}}

{{% aside1 %}}
OS X's ``dscl`` command is a command line utility for performing operations on the Directory Services database.
{{% /aside1 %}}

Confirm the shell that's set for your user:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}dscl . -read /Users/$USER UserShell
UserShell: /bin/zsh
{{< /prism >}}

The `` . `` is short for ``localhost``, and the ``$USER`` variable expands to your username. 

In a previous iteration of this post, I mentioned looking into ``/etc/shells`` to find out what shells your OS X knows about. It's not necessary to view or append this file, if you're setting your shell with ``dscl`` like we'll do below. It seems that ``/etc/shells`` is used to specify allowable user shells for users connecting via {{<abbr FTP>}}, and it used to need to be edited to include any new shells, that you were going to change to using ``chsh``. 

## Upgrade zsh with brew

{{< figure1 link="/img/homebrew.png" src="/img/homebrew.png" type="Logo" title="Homebrew" class="" >}}

Assuming you have ``brew`` installed, use `brew install zsh` to install.

{{< prism bash command-line >}}brew install zsh

### Confirm brew's zsh location

Apple provides `/usr/local` for OS X users to install packages to and it's already in your system path, so that's where `brew` installs. Confirm it:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}ls -la /usr/local/bin/zs*
  lrwxr-xr-x  1 rcogley  wheel  27 May 16 10:54 /usr/local/bin/zsh@ -> ../Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh
  lrwxr-xr-x  1 rcogley  wheel  33 May 16 10:54 /usr/local/bin/zsh-5.0.7@ -> ../Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh-5.0.7
{{< /prism >}}

But you can also use `brew` commands to confirm the details about the package:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}brew list
  aspell		automake	enscript	gettext		gsl114		libgpg-error	mtr		rsync
  autoconf	bazaar		gdbm		go		jenv		libksba		pcre		zsh
brew list zsh
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/bin/zsh-5.0.7
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/lib/zsh/ (35 files)
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/share/info/ (7 files)
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/share/man/ (17 files)
  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7/share/zsh/ (1036 files)
{{< /prism >}}

And...

{{< prism bash command-line >}}brew info zsh
  zsh: stable 5.0.7 (bottled)

  /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.0.7 (1084 files, 11M) *

  ==> Caveats
  Add the following to your zshrc to access the online help:
    unalias run-help
    autoload run-help
    HELPDIR=/usr/local/share/zsh/help
{{< /prism >}}

## Use the brew zsh

{{< figure1 link="/img/Cogley-Post-System-Preferences-User-Advanced-Options-for-Shell-Change.jpg" src="/img/Cogley-Post-System-Preferences-User-Advanced-Options-for-Shell-Change.thumb.jpg" type="Screenshot" title="Ctrl-click your username to get Advanced Options, to select your shell." class="" >}}

To use the ``zsh`` that brew installed, use ``dscl``. 

{{< prism bash command-line >}}sudo dscl . -create /Users/$USER UserShell /usr/local/bin/zsh
Password: *********
{{< /prism >}}

After that, **restart your Terminal** to have it take effect. You can also use System Preferences. Open Users & Groups, ctrl-click your username, then select "Advanced Options". You can select your shell in there. 

Now if you run `which` again, you'll see the system is recognizing the one you installed:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}which zsh
  /usr/local/bin/zsh
{{< /prism >}}

And confirming the version again shows:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}zsh --version
  zsh 5.0.7 (x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0)
{{< /prism >}}

{{% aside1 %}}
In standard linux, and in previous versions of Mac OS X, you would add a new shell like ``/usr/local/bin/zsh`` to ``/etc/shells``, then use ``chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh`` to change to it. 
{{% /aside1 %}}

Et voil√†! The ``zsh`` that is first in your path is now the upgraded version from ``brew``.

### Confirm You're Running Brew zsh

Now you can confirm which shell you are running with a couple of different commands. 

First, repeat the command you used above to confirm: 

{{< prism bash command-line >}}dscl . -read /Users/$USER UserShell
    UserShell: /usr/local/bin/zsh
{{< /prism >}}

That's the most precise way to confirm. Next, try echoing an environment variable (case matters):

{{< prism bash command-line >}}echo $SHELL
    /usr/local/bin/zsh
{{< /prism >}}

It should be the same result. Finally, check the name of the running process by doing ``echo $0``. It should return ``-zsh``.

### Set Shell within Terminal App

{{% aside1 %}}
Get [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com) if you haven't got it already. The [version 3 beta](https://www.iterm2.com/version3.html) is especially good, as of April 2016.
{{% /aside1 %}}

You can also set the shell within your terminal app, though I haven't tested this, and am not sure if there's any negative aspect to doing so. 

* **OS X Terminal** - Preferences, General, "Shells Open With" and set the path to your preferred shell.
* **iTerm 2** - Preferences, Profiles, General, Command.

I believe what this does is to store the selection within a ``plist`` file for that app, and ignore the user shell. 

## Handling Upgrades

There are a couple of considerations to keep in mind any time you upgrade OS X.

First, your shell might get reset, so check it to be sure.

Secondly, OS X El Capitan (v 10.11) has a new security system called "System Integrity Protection", which is set up to be stricter with the security of ``/usr/local``, among other things. Since this is where ``brew`` keeps its files, you'll likely need to reset security on it by running the following command:

{{< prism bash command-line >}}sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local
{{< /prism >}}

If you upgrade ``brew`` using ``brew update`` or ``brew upgrade``, it will inform you if there's a problem with permissions on ``/usr/local``.

## Supercharging Zsh

It's a matter for another post, but if you like ``zsh`` and want some cool tools for it, check out [Oh My Zsh!](http://ohmyz.sh/), an open source framework for managing ``zsh`` config.

## Updates

* **9 Apr 2016** - updated post to reflect more sure-fire way to set the zsh from the command line: use ``dscl``. Left information about ``/etc/shells`` and ``chsh`` in as an aside. Added information about selecting the shell in Terminal Preferences. 

* **25 Mar 2016** - checked version of ``zsh`` in OS X 10.11.4 El Capitan. It's ``zsh 5.0.8 (x86_64-apple-darwin15.0)``, which is still out of date and in fact, an even more pronounced version lag compared to the ``v5.2`` now being distributed via ``brew``. Added how to check which shell you actually are using, and a couple points about handling upgrades.
* **24 Mar 2016** - cleaned up the post a bit. Added restarting Terminal, per comments (thanks!). Added ack section. Added link to [Oh My Zsh!](http://ohmyz.sh/).

The banner photo has nothing to do with zsh. It's a photo I took of hula dancers at Shonan Mall near Fujisawa, a number of years ago. See the original [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rickcogley/3580716109).

Thanks to Kirk Beard and Adam in the comments, regarding restarting Terminal to have the ``chsh`` take effect.

Thanks to Trent Lucier for pointing out to me that it can be set in your Terminal program's preferences.
